# UHC-Run
Version 2.0 of the UHC Run plugin which was my first plugin. This version incorporates more classes to manage the gameâ€™s apects more efficiently.

# The Game
The principle is simple: create equipment and then fight alone against all in order to win, or win in teams. For more compact parts, the UHC (Ultra-Hardcore) Run mode only allows you to prepare for 20 minutes, but with easier resources to obtain (doubled ores for example). Then players are teleported and have to fight.

# Additions to the game
The game can be played by enabling or disabling certain additions, which can make the game faster:
- Teams: play by teams
- No teams: play solo
- Friendly fire: when you play as a team, you can hurt your allies
- Timber: breaks trees instantly when you break a log
- Hastey Boys: when you create a tool, it is directly enchanted
- Cutclean: when you mine an ore, its smelted version drops on the ground
